The assess_password_strength function takes a password string as input and calculates a score based on various criteria.
Each criterion (length, presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters) contributes 1 point to the total score if met.
The regular expressions are used to check for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
The total score is then used to classify the strength of the password as "Weak", "Moderate", or "Strong".
